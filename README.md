# cbpf-rust
![https://travis-ci.org/mmisono/rust-cbpf](https://travis-ci.org/mmisono/rust-cbpf.svg?branch=master)

This repository have two crates:

- [`cbpf`](./cbpf) : Userspace cBPF interpreter which can be run in a `no-std`
  environment and some related utilities.
- [`c2e`](./c2e) : Convert a cBPF program to the eBPF program.

Please see each directory for more details.

## Note
The main purpose of this project is to create eBPF programs which can be run
in my personal environment that use [ubpf](https://github.com/iovisor/ubpf) as
eBPF VM from libpcap's expressions.

This project is under development. Maybe there are some problems.
